# Φ THINK TANK

**Multi-Mind Terminal for Super Φ.Vessel**

A governed, event-sourced multi-mind control room. Cognitive roles are staffed by model/provider seats, coordinated through Commonline, routed by Crane Fly, evaluated through the Reality Gate, and kept under explicit human operator authority.

## Current rung

**PR 21 — RFC 3161 Trusted Timestamp Attestation**

The Think Tank can now request a standards-based RFC 3161 timestamp token for a portable transparency checkpoint and verify the returned token locally against an explicitly configured trust anchor using OpenSSL.

PR 21 adds:
- optional RFC 3161 TSA adapter
- SHA-256 checkpoint message imprints
- operator-configured TSA URL and CA/trust-anchor file
- local OpenSSL query generation and response verification
- TSA policy / serial / subject extraction
- raw timestamp-token retention
- token SHA-256 fingerprints
- governed timestamp request/completion/failure events
- timestamp receipts in canonical replay fingerprints
- Decision Dossier timestamp UI + export
- kernel and bridge receipt tests

### Important semantic rule

**RFC3161 VERIFIED ≠ UNIVERSALLY TRUSTED TIME ≠ TRUE DECISION.**

Verification means the configured RFC 3161 trust chain successfully attested the checkpoint digest at the token generation time. The assurance is only as strong as the operator-selected trust anchor, TSA operation, and local verification environment; it still says nothing about the factual correctness of the underlying decision.

## Local-first setup

    cp .env.example .env
    npm install
    npm run bridge

In another terminal:

    npm run dev

Verification:

    npm test
    npm run bridge:check
    npm run bridge:test
    npm run build

## Architectural law

> **If a light changes, a sequenced event explains why.**

Every normal synthesis carries a deterministic dossier; it can be Ed25519-sealed, appended to a local SHA-256 transparency journal, frozen into a portable checkpoint, independently witnessed, and optionally time-attested by an RFC 3161 authority under an explicit local trust anchor.

## Build ladder

1. ✅ Room shell + operator authority
2. ✅ Terminal identity + speech viewport
3. ✅ Event kernel + deterministic replay
4. ✅ Modes + scheduler + governance
5. ✅ Semantic motion layer
6. ✅ Crane Fly assignments
7. ✅ Provider adapters + LIVE execution
8. ✅ Reality Gate evidence engine
9. ✅ Machine-verified evidence retrieval
10. ✅ Claim registry + claim-to-source binding
11. ✅ Governed research / search
12. ✅ Challenger claim coverage audits
13. ✅ Claim-aware governance policy
14. ✅ Hash-locked source excerpts
15. ✅ Excerpt-aware Challenger argument review
16. ✅ Argument-map governance
17. ✅ Synthesis decision dossier
18. ✅ Cryptographic dossier sealing
19. ✅ Local dossier transparency journal
20. ✅ Portable checkpoints + detached witnesses
21. **RFC 3161 trusted timestamp attestation**

**Φ THINK TANK is a control room, not eight chat cards.**
