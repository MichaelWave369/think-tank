# Φ THINK TANK

**Multi-Mind Terminal for Super Φ.Vessel**

A governed, event-sourced multi-mind control room. Cognitive roles are staffed by model/provider seats, coordinated through Commonline, routed by Crane Fly, evaluated through the Reality Gate, and kept under explicit human operator authority.

## Current rung

**PR 20 — Portable Checkpoints + Detached Witnesses**

The Think Tank can now freeze an accepted transparency-journal head into a portable checkpoint, export it for independent signing, then import and cryptographically verify a detached Ed25519 witness receipt.

PR 20 adds:
- governed journal-head checkpoint creation
- SHA-256 checkpoint digests
- portable checkpoint JSON export
- independent Ed25519 witness key tooling
- detached off-machine checkpoint signing
- witness private-key isolation from the Think Tank bridge
- governed witness submission and verification events
- multiple independent witness keys per checkpoint
- Decision Dossier checkpoint/witness UI
- dossier export with checkpoint/witness receipts
- bridge and kernel tamper-detection tests

### Important semantic rule

**WITNESSED ≠ TRUSTED WITNESS ≠ TRUSTED TIME ≠ TRUE DECISION.**

A verified detached witness proves that a particular Ed25519 key signed a particular portable checkpoint. It does not establish the real-world identity or trustworthiness of the key owner, trusted time, factual truth, or decision correctness.

## Local-first setup

    cp .env.example .env
    npm install
    npm run bridge

In another terminal:

    npm run dev

Verification:

    npm test
    npm run bridge:check
    npm run bridge:test
    npm run build

## Architectural law

> **If a light changes, a sequenced event explains why.**

Every normal synthesis carries a deterministic dossier; it can be Ed25519-sealed, appended to a local SHA-256 transparency journal, frozen into a portable head checkpoint, and independently witnessed with a detached Ed25519 receipt.

## Build ladder

1. ✅ Room shell + operator authority
2. ✅ Terminal identity + speech viewport
3. ✅ Event kernel + deterministic replay
4. ✅ Modes + scheduler + governance
5. ✅ Semantic motion layer
6. ✅ Crane Fly assignments
7. ✅ Provider adapters + LIVE execution
8. ✅ Reality Gate evidence engine
9. ✅ Machine-verified evidence retrieval
10. ✅ Claim registry + claim-to-source binding
11. ✅ Governed research / search
12. ✅ Challenger claim coverage audits
13. ✅ Claim-aware governance policy
14. ✅ Hash-locked source excerpts
15. ✅ Excerpt-aware Challenger argument review
16. ✅ Argument-map governance
17. ✅ Synthesis decision dossier
18. ✅ Cryptographic dossier sealing
19. ✅ Local dossier transparency journal
20. **Portable checkpoints + detached witnesses**

**Φ THINK TANK is a control room, not eight chat cards.**
