# Φ THINK TANK

**Multi-Mind Terminal for Super Φ.Vessel**

A governed, event-sourced multi-mind control room. Cognitive roles are staffed by model/provider seats, coordinated through Commonline, routed by Crane Fly, evaluated through the Reality Gate, and kept under explicit human operator authority.

## Current rung

**PR 22 — Verified External Checkpoint Publication**

The Think Tank can now publish a portable checkpoint through an optional configured HTTPS publisher, then independently read the checkpoint back from a constrained public retrieval origin before accepting a publication receipt.

PR 22 adds:
- `phi-checkpoint-publication-v1` protocol
- operator-authorized checkpoint publication
- server-side optional bearer authentication
- pinned public-network validation for publish + retrieval destinations
- no-redirect publication/read-back requests
- exact retrieval-origin enforcement
- exact stable-canonical checkpoint read-back verification
- publisher-claimed time kept explicitly separate from trusted time
- governed publication request/completion/failure events
- publication receipts in replay fingerprints and dossier exports
- Decision Dossier publication status/UI
- bridge and kernel tamper/failure tests

### Important semantic rule

**PUBLISHED ≠ IMMUTABLE ≠ ENDORSED ≠ TRUE DECISION.**

A verified publication receipt proves that the bridge successfully read the exact checkpoint back from the accepted external retrieval URL after publication. It does not prove permanent availability, append-only storage, publisher endorsement, trusted publisher time, or factual correctness.

## Local-first setup

    cp .env.example .env
    npm install
    npm run bridge

In another terminal:

    npm run dev

Verification:

    npm test
    npm run bridge:check
    npm run bridge:test
    npm run build

## Architectural law

> **If a light changes, a sequenced event explains why.**

Every normal synthesis carries a deterministic dossier; it can be Ed25519-sealed, appended to a local SHA-256 transparency journal, frozen into a portable checkpoint, independently witnessed, time-attested by RFC 3161, and externally published with verified HTTPS read-back.

## Build ladder

1. ✅ Room shell + operator authority
2. ✅ Terminal identity + speech viewport
3. ✅ Event kernel + deterministic replay
4. ✅ Modes + scheduler + governance
5. ✅ Semantic motion layer
6. ✅ Crane Fly assignments
7. ✅ Provider adapters + LIVE execution
8. ✅ Reality Gate evidence engine
9. ✅ Machine-verified evidence retrieval
10. ✅ Claim registry + claim-to-source binding
11. ✅ Governed research / search
12. ✅ Challenger claim coverage audits
13. ✅ Claim-aware governance policy
14. ✅ Hash-locked source excerpts
15. ✅ Excerpt-aware Challenger argument review
16. ✅ Argument-map governance
17. ✅ Synthesis decision dossier
18. ✅ Cryptographic dossier sealing
19. ✅ Local dossier transparency journal
20. ✅ Portable checkpoints + detached witnesses
21. ✅ RFC 3161 trusted timestamp attestation
22. **Verified external checkpoint publication**

**Φ THINK TANK is a control room, not eight chat cards.**
